# Conjugate-Gradient-Solver

This is a small set of python programs which can solve a system of linear equations, using the conjugate gradient method. This only works for positive definite coefficient matrices, but is very powerful. The difference in number of iterations is observed to be very large.

Now added the ability to minimize any non-linear function. Have not handled exceptions, and is guaranteed to work on most convex functions. Worked decently well for both 1-D and 2-D cases. Have hard-coded upto 3-D, can be scaled to arbitrary input with little effort
